#  Automated Robotic Screw Inspection and Classification

An **industrial automation project** that integrates **robotics, artificial vision, and data-driven classification** to automatically **inspect, measure, classify, and sort screws** using two industrial robots and machine vision.

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **fully automated quality inspection system** for screws, combining:

* **Robotic manipulation** (ABB IRB 140 & KUKA KR3)
* **ROS-based coordination**
* **Industrial cameras & structured lighting**
* **MATLAB-based image processing**
* **Geometric feature extraction & classification**

The system performs:

* Screw head inspection
* Screw thread measurement
* Defect detection
* Screw classification & sorting

##  Robot Modeling & Motion Planning

###  Forward Kinematics

* Computes end-effector pose from joint angles
* Homogeneous transformation matrices used
* Required for accurate camera positioning

###  Inverse Kinematics

* Analytical solution for first 3 joints
* Rotation-matrix-based solution for wrist joints
* Newton–Raphson method for numerical refinement

###  Body Jacobian

* Maps joint velocities to end-effector velocities
* Used for:

  * Velocity control
  * Manipulability analysis

###  Trajectory Planning

* **Trapezoidal velocity profiles**
* Smooth acceleration & deceleration
* Point-to-point and via-point trajectories
